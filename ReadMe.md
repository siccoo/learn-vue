## Learning Vue - a Front end tool for creating dynamic, amazing and awesome website. 

## Overview and Installation process

-   Vue CLI is a full system for rapid Vue.js development, providing:

-   Interactive project scaffolding via `@vue/cli`.
-   Zero config rapid prototyping via `@vue/cli` + `@vue/cli-service-global`.
-   A runtime dependency (`@vue/cli-service`) that is:
-   Upgradeable;
-   Built on top of webpack, with sensible defaults;
-   Configurable via in-project config file;
-   Extensible via plugins
-   A rich collection of official plugins integrating the best tools in the frontend ecosystem.
-   A full graphical user interface to create and manage Vue.js projects.
-   Vue CLI aims to be the standard tooling baseline for the Vue ecosystem. It ensures the various -       build tools work smoothly together with sensible defaults so you can focus on writing your app         instead of spending days wrangling with configurations. At the same time, it still offers the          flexibility to tweak the config of each tool without the need for ejecting.

## Installation and Getting Started

-   Vue CLI requires Node.js `version 8.9` or above `(8.11.0+ recommended)`. You can manage multiple       versions of Node on the same machine with nvm or nvm-windows

-   `npm install -g @vue/cli` or  `yarn global add @vue/cli`.
